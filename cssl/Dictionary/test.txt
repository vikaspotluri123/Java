Each data part of an object is referred to as a data member while the operations can be referred to as methods. The current state of an object is stored in its data members and that state should only be changed or accessed through the methods. Common categories of operations include: the construction of objects; operations that either set (mutator methods) or return (accessor methods) the data members; operations unique to the data type; and operations used internally by the object.
formatted output	Data prepared for output in order to be displayed in a desired format (for example, trailing zero on 7.50$ instead of 7.5$).
logic circuit	A circuit whose output can be determined by knowing the input and by following the path through the logic gates.
system life cycle	The course of development changes through which a system passes from its conception to the termination of its use; for example, the phases and activities associated with the analysis, acquisition, design, development, testing, integration, operation, maintenance, and modification of a system.
push	To add an item to the top of a stack.
network	Any set of interconnected computer systems that share resources and data. See also the definitions for "networking", "local area network (LAN)" and "wide area network (WAN)".
parameter	A parameter is passed to a routine or method by variable name and type. When the code is run, the parameter is replaced by the value of the variable, and becomes the argument of the routine, referred to by the variable name in the definition.
data bus	The pathway between the memory or peripheral and processing unit that carries data for processing or data that has been processed. See also definitions for "bus" and "address bus".
parsing	The breaking down of high-level programming language statements into their component parts during the translation process. An example would be identifying reserved words and variables.
pass-by-value	The parameter-passing mechanism by which a copy of the value of the actual parameter is passed to the called procedure. If the called procedure modifies the formal parameter, the corresponding actual parameter is not affected. In Java, all primitives are passed-by-value. See also the definition for "pass-by-reference".
user-defined objects	Objects whose members and methods are defined by the user and not inherent in the language.
systems flowchart	A flowchart used to describe a complete data processing system, with the flow of data through the clerical operations involved, down to the level of individual programs, but excluding details of such programs.
computer-assisted software engineering	The automation of well-defined methodologies that are used in the development and maintenance of products. These methodologies apply to nearly every process or activity of a product development cycle, for example: project planning, product designing, coding and testing.
CRC cards	Class, responsibility, collaboration cards. A design tool for classes that lists a class's name, its responsibilities and the classes with which it collaborates on an index card.
storage requirements	A description of how much memory is required during the running of the program.
rotational delay	In a disk drive, the time required for the disk to revolve until the correct sector is under/over the read/write heads. See also the definition for "seek time".
interface	The hardware and associated software needed for communication between processors and peripheral devices to compensate for the difference in their operating characteristics.
inheritance	The name given to the property whereby an object, which extends another object, inherits the data members and member functions of the original.
storyboard	A diagrammatic form of a prototype showing a planned sequence of screen displays, demonstrating the different paths available to the user.
microwave transmission	A method of electronic communication that does not require cables.
FIFO	First-in-first-out. See also the definitions for "queue", "stack" and "LIFO".
infix notation	A notation for representing logical operators in which the operator is written between the operands, for example, A+B or A*B. See also the definitions for "postfix notation" and "prefix notation".
requirements specification	A document that sets out the customer requirements of a computer system. It is written as part of the systems analysis and can be used later to evaluate the system when implemented.
parameter passing	The assignment of values to parameters to be used in a procedure.
constructor method	A method with the same name as the class that initializes the instance variables of an object of the class when the object is instantiated.
clash (collision)	A situation in which two or more entries in a file or other data structure are given the same memory location through the use of a hash table.
